# Optable Android SDK [![](https://jitci.com/gh/Optable/optable-android-sdk/svg)](https://jitci.com/gh/Optable/optable-android-sdk)

Kotlin SDK for integrating with optable-sandbox from an Android application.

## Build Demo App

From [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), navigate to `File > Open` and open the `DemoApp/DemoAppKotlin` directory. You should be able to build and run the resulting project directly, since it will automatically download the `co.optable.android_sdk` library from [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/) Maven repository.
